# MinecraftSplashTextTranslation
Starter project!

this was made to allow community to translate untranslatable things in minecraft like splashes or end text

you dont have to follow any glossary but it is recommended to do!

if you want to contribute just go to the Splash text translations/assets/minecraft/texts/    folder and find/create file of the text and translate...
you have to create pull requests in order for me to see your contribution and allowing your changes
once you have made your pull request you can edit the file further
you can also review changes in other pull requests too!
